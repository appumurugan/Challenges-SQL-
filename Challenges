Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.


SELECT H.hacker_id, H.name, COUNT(C.challenge_id) as no_of_challenges
FROM Hackers H
JOIN Challenges C ON H.hacker_id = C.hacker_id
GROUP BY H.hacker_id, H.name
HAVING no_of_challenges = (SELECT count(challenge_id) AS max_count FROM Challenges GROUP BY hacker_id ORDER BY max_count DESC LIMIT 1)
OR no_of_challenges IN (SELECT t.cnt FROM (SELECT count(challenge_id) AS cnt FROM Challenges GROUP BY hacker_id) t GROUP BY t.cnt HAVING COUNT(t.cnt) = 1)
ORDER BY no_of_challenges DESC, H.hacker_id ASC;
